Task: Create a model to predict which passengers survived the tradgedy.
From: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted

The Titanic sunk on maiden voyage, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. There were not enough lifeboats, though some groups more likely to survive than others (women, children and upper-class).

This repository contains my approach to the Titanic survival prediction Problem from Kaggle. The repository includes scripts for feature selection, alternate strategies for data modelling, the original test & train data sets and the visualizations plots generated for the same. All code snippets are written in R.
